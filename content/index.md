*I'm open to new ideas and perspectives, feel free to have a conversation with me on what ideas and perspectives you think I should understand!*

Welcome to my digital brain! Here you'll find random thoughts and notes I've taken to further describe how I view and operate in the world. My goal is to constantly update my thinking and beliefs to be more accurate and in line with how the world actually works.

## Now, now, now
I currently work at a large tech company where I build internal tools. On the side, I also work on personal coding projects, that are essentially glorified Excel sheets with a better UI. 

Around 2015-2018, I read over hundreds of books, but never took notes or kept track of them, so in 2025, I've decided to keep track in my [[reading list]].

I'm also writing random thoughts, that will undergo editing as I have conversations with others. Feel free to bring up any of the topics I write about and ask me to clarify or have me listen to you in person!

[^1]: For some reason, people don't like this quote and what it stands for. To elaborate why I like it, it's because I am always learning, and will update my views based on whatever is more accurate and true. What this means is I will say things that I believe with conviction, but know that there is a high possibility that my belief can be outdated after more information arrives. I look to confirm and disapprove whatever my opinions are by looking for evidence on all sides, which hopefully makes me know what is true more often than not.
