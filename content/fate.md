I define fate as the life we inherently have along the intersection between free will and determinism. Free will is defined as you decide what you do every day. Determinism is defined as you do things according to what you were always going to do, regardless if you decided to do it.

In my eyes, I look at fate as something everyone can change, but only through sheer will and dedication.

An easy way for me to describe how I view fate is by using an analogy. A person is tied by a red string, being pulled forward until they die. This person is tied to the string, so they can't escape it, but the thing is, they can wiggle around. 

Now here's the kicker: the amount of wiggling you can do depends the length of string between you and where you are being pulled. You can think of this as the length of your life. Each person has a length that is invisible to them.

Now when you wiggle, depending on how much you wiggle (through will and determination), you can affect where the string gets pulled towards. If the string is longer, you have a higher chance of changing your fate. If the string is shorter, you have a lower chance of changing your fate. But there is always a chance.

The question is: what do you do? You can decide to [[how to change another person's mind|change]] your fate through free will, or you can accept your fate. The choice is up to you.

Master your biology or have it master you.
