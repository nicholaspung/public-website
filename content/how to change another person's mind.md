Simply put, you can't. Only the other person can change their mind. You can influence their decision to change their mind, but it doesn't mean you actually changed their mind. They decided to change it.

How does a person change their mind? Either fast by emotions or deliberately over time.

How do you know when a person has changed their mind? When their actions start changing.
