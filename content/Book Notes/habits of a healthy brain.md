## My quick summary
- *to be filled out*

### Ratings
- **Reading difficulty:** slog through a few sections, might take some energy to focus
- **Recommendation:** learned a few things, but could probably have learned it all in a blog post

### My notes

#### Highlights
- ...your brain has some quirks:
	1. It cares for the survival of your genes as urgently as it cares for your body.
	2. It wires itself from early experience, though that's an imperfect guide to adult survival.
- Dopamine
	- Produces the joy of finding things that meet your needs - the "Eureka! I got it!" feeling.
		- "the joy of finding what you seek"
	- Motivates you to get what you need, even when it takes a lot of effort.
		- "seek rewards"
	- Promotes survival by telling your body where to invest its energy
		- "the excitement you feel when you expect a reward"
- Endorphin
	- Produces oblivion that masks pain - often called euphoria.
		- "the oblivion that masks pain"
	- Motivates you to ignore pain, so you can escape from harm when you're injured.
		- "ignore physical pain"
	- Makes pain for a short time, which promotes survival by giving an injured mammal a chance to reach safety
	- Did not evolve to mask social pain
- Oxytocin
	- Produces the feeling of being safe with others - now called bonding.
		- "the comfort of social alliances"
	- Motivates you to trust others, to find safety in companionship.
		- "build social alliances"
	- When you trust someone, or enjoy someone's trust in you, oxytocin is flowing. The pleasure of belonging or safety in numbers is oxytocin too
	- Touch trigger oxytocin
	- "...the pleasure of letting down your guard near those you trust. It's not the conscious decision to trust, but the physical feeling of safety you get from proximity to trusted others."
- Serotonin
	- Produces the feeling of being respected by others - pride.
		- "the security of social importance"
	- Motivates you to get respect, which expands your mating opportunities and protects your offspring.
		- "get respect from others"
- Happy moments in your past connected neurons that are there, ready to spark more happy chemicals the next time you're in similar circumstances. Unhappy moments in your past connected neurons that are there telling you what to avoid
- Your neurons have difficulty sending electricity down a path you've never activated before. Each time a pathway is activated, it fires more easily. Repetition develops a neural trail slowly, the way a dirt path hardens from years of use. So how can you build new pathways? The answer is simple: Feed your brain new experiences again and again. Repetition will build the circuits you want. No one can build them for you, and you cannot build them for someone else.
- Focus on your own pathways
	- It's easy to see vicious cycles in others. That's why we're tempted to take charge of other people's happiness. But you cannot reach into someone else's brain and make new connections for them, nor can they do that for you. If you focus on other people's brains, you may fail to make them happy and fail to make yourself happy. Each person must manage his or her own limbic system.
- Love is a huge surge of happy chemicals because it's hugely relevant to the survival of your genes
	- Dopamine is stimulated by the "chase" aspect of love
	- Oxytocin is stimulated by touch and by trust
	- Serotonin is stimulated by the status aspect of love - the pride of associating with a person of a certain stature
	- Endorphin is stimulated by physical pain, but you can get a bit from laughing and crying too
	- Cortisol plays an important role in reproductive success, too. It makes you feel bad when you lose love, which promotes survival by helping you move on
	- There is no free love in nature. Every species has preliminary qualifying events before mating
- Endorphin did not evolve to motivate self-inflicted pain. It evolved to escape pain
- The respite of endorphin is brief because pain has survival value
	- Pain is your body's signal that something is urgently wrong
- You would not make good survival choices if you were always high on endorphin. We evolved to notice distress signals, not to keep masking them with oblivion
- Endorphin is different from adrenaline
	- You anticipate pain and your body releases adrenaline to handle the emergency. The "adrenaline junkie" is not seeking pain, but the rush of energy designed to avoid pain
	- Adrenaline is outside the scope of this book because it does not cause happiness. It causes a state of arousal, as if your body is stepping on the gas. Some people learn to like that feeling, but it is not a signal that something is good for you.
- For most of human history, people spent their lives in the network of attachments they were born into
	- Today, lasting attachments are less preferred and often disparaged. Without them, however, we feel like something is wrong. We don't know why, but we long for the place where "everybody knows your name."
- Over time, you "know who your friends are" because your neurochemicals react to individuals as "good for your survival" or "bad for your survival"
- Getting respect feels good because it triggers serotonin. The good feeling motivates you to seek more respect, and that promotes survival.
- In the animal world, getting respect clearly promotes an individual's DNA. They're not thinking about genes, of course. They seek social dominance because serotonin makes it feel good. They avoid conflict because it's linked to pain. The mammal brain is always looking for ways to enjoy the good feeling of serotonin without the bad feeling of pain.
- In mammals, serotonin is the good feeling of having secure access to food or other resources
- Humans strive to curb these impulses, but we've inherited a brain that makes social dominance feel good
- Serotonin is the feeling of being important. We see how much others like to feel important, but we hate to see this in ourselves. It helps to know that our brain was naturally selected to seek social dominance, because brains that did so made more copies of their genes. We strive to avoid conflict because aggression can wipe out your genes. So the mammal brain keeps calculating social data, and when you find a safe way to assert yourself, it rewards you with serotonin
- When cortisol surges, we call it "fear," but when cortisol dribbles, we call it "anxiety" or "stress." These bad feelings tell you that pain will come if you don't act fast. Your reptile brain can't say why it released the cortisol. Electricity just flowed down a pathway. When you understand how this happens, you can distinguish more easily between internal alarms and external threats
- When you think about threats your ancestors faced, no cortisol doom is triggered because direct experience is what builds cortisol circuits, and you share little direct experience with your ancestors
- Whatever triggered cortisol in your past build neural pathways that alert you to avoid harm today. You can call it stress, anxiety, fear, or panic depending on the intensity, but cortisol makes you feel like something awful will happen if you don't do something now. It's hard to know what turns it on because it's just electricity flowing down a well-developed chain of neurons. But if you pay careful attention to your bad feelings, you can find patterns. That helps you make new decisions about avoiding harm instead of just flowing with old information. Bad feelings may still come because the pathways are still there. But when you know it's an old response to an old threat, you stop seeing evidence to feed it, so the feeling just passes.
